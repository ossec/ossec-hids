== OSSEC, os_xml "library" ==
Copyright (C) 2009 Trend Micro Inc.

This "library" is a set of very simple functions to read
a XML configuration file.

It can only read XML, not write. I did not test it on very
complex XML files, so I don't know if it will work.

Any question, comment or suggestion, please contact me
at dcid@ossec.net or daniel@underlinux.com.br.

The latest version of this library is available at
http://www.ossec.net/

== Examples ==

The file examples/main.c shows some examples (reading example.xml) on
how to use the "os_xml" to read an XML file. Basically, you only need to
start your XML" by calling the ReadXML function (the file as argument)
and use the other supplied functions to read the structure it creates.
