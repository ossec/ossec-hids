= OSSEC, os_regex Library. =

Fast and simple library for regular expressions in C.

This library is designed to be simple, but support
the most common regular expressions. It was design
with intrusion detection systems in mind, where having
all options is not crucial, but speed is.

The following expressions are supported:
    \w  ->  A-Z, a-z, 0-9 characters
    \d  ->  0-9 characters
    \s  ->  For spaces " "
    \p  ->  ()*+,-.:;<=>?[]!"'#$%&|{} (punctuation characters)
    \W  ->  For anything not \w
    \D  ->  For anything not \d
    \S  ->  For anything not \s
    \.  ->  For anything

Each regular expression can be followed by:

    +  ->  To match one or more times (eg \w+ or \d+)
    *  ->  To match zero or more times (eg \w* or \p*)

We also support the "^" to match at the beginning of the text,
'$" to match at the end of the text and "|" to have multiple
expressions.
