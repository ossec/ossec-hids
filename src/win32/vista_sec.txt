4608, Windows is starting up. This event is logged when LSASS.EXE starts and the auditing subsystem is initialized.
4609, Windows is shutting down. All logon sessions will be terminated by this shutdown.
4610, An authentication package has been loaded by the Local Security Authority. This authentication package will be used to authenticate logon attempts.  Authentication Package Name: %1
4611, This logon process will be trusted to submit logon requests. Subject:  Security ID:  %1  Account Name:  %2  Account Domain:  %3  Logon ID:  %4  Logon Process Name:  %5
4612, Internal resources allocated for the queuing of audit messages have been exhausted, leading to the loss of some audits. Number of audit messages discarded: %1  This event is generated when audit queues are filled and events must be discarded.  This most commonly occurs when security events are being generated faster than they are being written to disk, or when the auditing system loses connectivity to the event log, such as when the event log service is stopped.
4614, A notification package has been loaded by the Security Account Manager. This package will be notified of any account or password changes.  Notification Package Name: %1
4615, Invalid use of LPC port. Subject:  Security ID:  %1  Account Name:  %2  Account Domain:  %3  Logon ID:  %4  Process Information:  PID:   %7  Name:   %8  Invalid Use:  %5  LPC Server Port Name: %6  Windows Local Security Authority (LSA) communicates with the Windows kernel using Local Procedure Call (LPC) ports. If you see this event, an application has inadvertently or intentionally accessed this port which is reserved exclusively for LSA's use. The application (process) should be investigated to ensure that it is not attempting to tamper with this communications channel.
4616, The system time was changed. Subject:  Security ID:  %1  Account Name:  %2  Account Domain:  %3  Logon ID:  %4  Process Information:  Process ID: %9  Name:  %10  Previous Time:  %6 %5 New Time:  %8 %7  This event is generated when the system time is changed. It is normal for the Windows Time Service, which runs with System privilege, to change the system time on a regular basis. Other system time changes may be indicative of attempts to tamper with the computer.
4618, A monitored security event pattern has occurred. Subject:  Security ID:  %3  Account Name:  %4  Account Domain:  %5  Logon ID:  %6  Alert Information:  Computer:  %2  Event ID:  %1  Number of Events: %7  Duration:  %8  This event is generated when Windows is configured to generate alerts in accordance with the Common Criteria Security Audit Analysis requirements (FAU_SAA) and an auditable event pattern occurs.
4621, Administrator recovered system from CrashOnAuditFail. Users who are not administrators will now be allowed to log on. Some auditable activity might not have been recorded. Value of CrashOnAuditFail: %1  This event is logged after a system reboots following CrashOnAuditFail.
4622, A security package has been loaded by the Local Security Authority. Security Package Name: %1
4624, An account was successfully logged on. Subject:  Security ID:  %1  Account Name:  %2  Account Domain:  %3  Logon ID:  %4  Logon Type:   %9  New Logon:  Security ID:  %5  Account Name:  %6  Account Domain:  %7  Logon ID:  %8  Logon GUID:  %13  Process Information:  Process ID:  %17  Process Name:  %18  Network Information:  Workstation Name: %12  Source Network Address: %19  Source Port:  %20  Detailed Authentication Information:  Logon Process:  %10  Authentication Package: %11  Transited Services: %14  Package Name (NTLM only): %15  Key Length:  %16  This event is generated when a logon session is created. It is generated on the computer that was accessed.
4625, An account failed to log on. Subject:  Security ID:  %1  Account Name:  %2  Account Domain:  %3  Logon ID:  %4  Logon Type:   %11  Account For Which Logon Failed:  Security ID:  %5  Account Name:  %6  Account Domain:  %7  Failure Information:  Failure Reason:  %9  Status:   %8  Sub Status:  %10  Process Information:  Caller Process ID: %18  Caller Process Name: %19  Network Information:  Workstation Name: %14  Source Network Address: %20  Source Port:  %21  Detailed Authentication Information:  Logon Process:  %12  Authentication Package: %13  Transited Services: %15  Package Name (NTLM only): %16  Key Length:  %17  This event is generated when a logon request fails. It is generated on the computer where access was attempted.
4634, An account was logged off. Subject:  Security ID:  %1  Account Name:  %2  Account Domain:  %3  Logon ID:  %4  Logon Type:   %5  This event is generated when a logon session is destroyed. It may be positively correlated with a logon event using the Logon ID value. Logon IDs are only unique between reboots on the same computer.
4647, User initiated logoff: Subject:  Security ID:  %1  Account Name:  %2  Account Domain:  %3  Logon ID:  %4  This event is generated when a logoff is initiated but the token reference count is not zero and the logon session cannot be destroyed.  No further user-initiated activity can occur.  This event can be interpreted as a logoff event.
4648, A logon was attempted using explicit credentials. Subject:  Security ID:  %1  Account Name:  %2  Account Domain:  %3  Logon ID:  %4  Logon GUID:  %5  Account Whose Credentials Were Used:  Account Name:  %6  Account Domain:  %7  Logon GUID:  %8  Target Server:  Target Server Name: %9  Additional Information: %10  Process Information:  Process ID:  %11  Process Name:  %12  Network Information:  Network Address: %13  Port:   %14  This event is generated when a process attempts to log on an account by explicitly specifying that accountâ€™s credentials.  This most commonly occurs in batch-type configurations such as scheduled tasks, or when using the RUNAS command.
4649, A replay attack was detected. Subject:  Security ID:  %1  Account Name:  %2  Account Domain:  %3  Logon ID:  %4  Credentials Which Were Replayed:  Account Name:  %5  Account Domain:  %6  Process Information:  Process ID:  %12  Process Name:  %13  Network Information:  Workstation Name: %10  Detailed Authentication Information:  Request Type:  %7  Logon Process:  %8  Authentication Package: %9  Transited Services: %11  This event indicates that a Kerberos replay attack was detected- a request was received twice with identical information. This condition could be caused by network misconfiguration.

4960, IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a network issue or that packets are being modified in transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. Remote Network Address: %1 Inbound SA SPI:  %2
4961, IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer. Remote Network Address: %1 Inbound SA SPI:  %2
4962, IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay. Remote Network Address: %1 Inbound SA SPI:  %2
