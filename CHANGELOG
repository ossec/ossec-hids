  *  Alert Output support for JSON and ZeroMQ

  *  Syscheck improvements
            Report file deletion, even without realtime enabled
            Report modifications made on directories
            Corrects bug so that files created between the first and second scan are reported as new files
            Corrects bug that made changes reverting a file to the state it was in when ossec started unreported
            Avoids computing hashes multiple times to improve performance
            Make the time between two syscheck wakeups configurable in internal_options
            Add support for the “nodiff” option when using report_changes, sensitive files tagged with <nodiff> in ossec.conf will have their contents included in an alert.

  *  IPv6 support

  *  Support to call an external mailer. This solves the problem of supporting encryption when sending mail alerts in OSSEC. The <smtp_server> field can now be prepended with “/” to designate a local binary. Example: “<smtp_server>/usr/sbin/sendmail -t</smtp_server>”.

  *  Slack notification support
