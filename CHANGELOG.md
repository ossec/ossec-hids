**Release notes**

This would have been a minor 3.4.1 update if it wasnt for Boris Lukashev of https://www.sempervictus.com
contributing a much needed update to multi-line log analysis. Previous usage of multi-line in OSSEC in
the past was limited in processing events that did not use indentiation, a fairly common modern practice
for readability. This update adds a new type: multi-line_indented to handle this condition (Example: postgresql). 

Maintenance fixes in this release also address issue #1781, which affected maild when calling an external program, and add support for Fedora 31


Whats New:

(@atomicturtle) - Fedora 31 Support
(@sempervictus) - Implement multi-line collection for indented logs #1780
(@drsjb80) -  Added authentication log file location for debian-based systems #1784


General

(@ddpbsd) - Fix for Issue #1781, corrects issues with program sending mail

Release Notes

	OSSECCON 2019, from the whole team here at OSSEC it was really fantastic meeting everyone at the show, and we look forward to seeing you all again at OSSECCON 2020!
	PCRE2, Jubois made a major update to the IDS foundation in OSSEC 3.3.0 with PCRE2 (https://www.pcre.org/current/doc/html/pcre2.html) library. This is an extremely powerful update to the overall pattern analysis functionaility in OSSEC. In order to build this with the native distribution pcre2 packages (pcre2-devel, etc), you will need to use: export PCRE2_SYSTEM=yes. This adds several new xml tags:
	    - pcre2 (to replace regex)
	    - match_pcre2
	    - program_name_pcre2
	    - prematch_pcre2
	    - srcgeoip_pcre2
	    - dstgeoip_pcre2
	    - srcport_pcre2
	    - dstport_pcre2
	    - user_pcre2
	    - url_pcre2
	    - id_pcre2
	    - status_pcre2
	    - hostname_pcre2
	    - extra_data_pcre2

	Dynamic Decoders, discussed in the "Beyond Security" talk at OSSECCON 2019, this allows for user-defined keys in decoders. These are exposed in JSON output for inclusion with other data analytics tools. This adds a new internal option: analysisd.decoder_order_size  to define the maximum number keys allowed in a single decoder.

Release Notes
	The great JSON-in-ing has begun! New features in this release focus on extending JSON output support to control commands like agent_control, syscheck_control, and rootcheck_control. Additional extensions add support for archives.log in native json format, and improving the alert.json output. This release also also brings some much needed enhancements to ossec-authd to streamline the agent registration experience (thanks nhatking16591!), Bob-Andrews continues on major auditing improvements plus support for Solaris 11. 

	We'd like to thank all the great contributors (named and anonymous!) who continue to improve ossec and support our community. We'd also like to welcome all our new contributors to OSSEC on this release. They have helped us on bug testing, documentation, new features, rules, compliance checks, code and more. There are no small contributions to a project like OSSEC, and we continue to thrive with your support. Special thanks to security researchers A.P. and S.S. for their audit of the ossec project, your work has greatly benefited the community. 

	If you're interested in joining our team, or just interacting with us on slack email us at: invite@ossec.net

	Decoders filename attribute
		PR #915 - A few fixes, but most importantly the ability to set the filename attribute from a decoder. This will help create automated pipelines for FIM Verification. I currently need to compare FIM events against 1) Puppet, 2) GIT, and 3) RPM. This patch allows FIM events to be intercepted by my custom FIM Verification script, which generates logging events which OSSEC can read and turn back into an event with the filename attribute set.
